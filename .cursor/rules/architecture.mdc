# Evolve File Processor Project Architecture

This project is a Python-based backend service using FastAPI, designed for AI applications and deployment on Tencent Cloud. It follows a clean, layered architecture.

## Key Files & Directories

### Application Logic (lives in `[api/](mdc:api)`)

The entire backend application code resides within the `api/` directory.

-   **Entrypoint**: The main FastAPI application is defined in `[api/index.py](mdc:api/index.py)`. This is the entry point for the application.
-   **API Endpoints**: REST API routes are defined in the `[api/endpoints/](mdc:api/endpoints)` directory. Each file typically represents a resource (e.g., documents, agents).
-   **Services**: Business logic is separated into service classes within the `[api/services/](mdc:api/services)` directory. Endpoints should call services to perform actions.
-   **Database Models**: SQLAlchemy models, which define the database table structures, should be placed in the `api/models/` directory (which we should create). All models must inherit from `Base` defined in `[api/db/base.py](mdc:api/db/base.py)`.
-   **Pydantic Schemas**: Data validation and serialization models (for API request/response bodies) are located in `[api/schemas/](mdc:api/schemas)`.
-   **Core Configuration**: Core application settings can be found in `[api/core/](mdc:api/core)`.
-   **Database Setup**: The SQLAlchemy `Base` and future database session management logic is in `[api/db/](mdc:api/db)`.

### Database Migrations (`[alembic/](mdc:alembic)`)

-   The project uses **Alembic** for database migrations, configured in `[alembic.ini](mdc:alembic.ini)`.
-   The environment setup, which connects to the database and finds models, is in `[alembic/env.py](mdc:alembic/env.py)`.
-   Generated migration scripts are stored in `[alembic/versions/](mdc:alembic/versions)`.
-   **To create a new migration**, run `poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`.
-   **To apply migrations**, run `poetry run alembic upgrade head`.

### Dependency Management

-   Project dependencies are managed with Poetry in `[pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml)`.
-   For Docker deployment, a `[requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt)` file is generated from Poetry's lock file.
-   **IMPORTANT**: After changing dependencies in `[pyproject.toml](mdc:pyproject.toml)`, you **must** regenerate `[requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt)` by running `poetry lock && poetry run pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

### Deployment

-   Deployment to Tencent Cloud is configured in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
-   The application is deployed as Docker containers using Docker Compose.
-   Nginx is configured to provide HTTPS access through the domain `file-processor.evolving.team`.
